A extension for Makecode Arcade, render a tilemap to 2.5D view, with directional animations of sprites, and minimap
based on mmoskal's "3d map", https://forum.makecode.com/t/3d-raycasting-in-arcade/474
Tested on my Meobit (STM32F4) about 25~30 fps (I have no SAMD51 device, tell me pls if you tested)

## features:
* Simply interface
* Directional multi sprites with animation, see animation.ts
* Auto direction/animate calculate, any count
* Predefined animations(hero, princess, skelly, â€¦), or define yours as Image[][]
* Manipulate sprite in your own main code, no need update to engine
* Mimimap
* FOV(field of view), zoom in/out

## todo:
* collide & events
* enclose into blocks

## known issues:
* ~~sprite isn't drawn when it's center not inside screen~~, fixed
* sprite floating when reducing height rate, will fix later
